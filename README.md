## Steps to use the new block

The following steps are neededto place the block to "my site":

* login as administrator
* go to "my side"
* hide courseoverview (the old block)
* go to "main side"
* add new block -> courseoverview +
* configure courseoverview +
* show on all sides
* go to "main side"
* configure courseoverview +
* show on "my side"

Important here is that under no circumstances should both blocks (courseoverview and courseoverview +) be active in the same side, because courseoverview + uses some function of courseoverview that are not considered to be functioning by more than one block.
